    "### Classifier parameters vs hyper-parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "Training of a classifier consists of using the training data to find good values for the *parameters* of the model (e.g. the weight vector of the perceptron algorithm).\n",
    "All the classifiers we have seen thus far have additional parameters that control the classifier's training, and need to set by the user.  These are called *hyper-parameters*. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* KNN:  number of nearest neighbors\n",
    "* Perceptron:  learning rate\n",
    "* Ridge regression:  regularization parameter\n",
    "* Non-linear SVM:  soft-margin constant and kernel parameter (degree of polynomial kernel or width of Gaussian kernel).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### The wrong way to select hyper-parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "Our temptation is to do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Divide the data into train and test sets\n",
    "* Loop over a set of potential values for the hyper-parameter(s)\n",
    "* For each value of the hyper-parmeter(s) train a classifier on the training set and evaluate it on the test set\n",
    "* Report to the user the value of the best performing classifier\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is this wrong?  The choice of which value to report to the user uses information about the test set, and the end-result is an accuracy estimate that is over-optimistic.  Think of a hyperparameter as yet another parameter that needs to be set algorithmically, which we never do using the test set!  As you know, estimates of classifier performance should never be based on performance on the test set!\n",
    "So what can we do?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use a validation set!\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a variation of the above procedure, that introduces the idea of using a **validation set**, a subset of the data used for choosing hyperparameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Divide the data into **training, validation, and test** sets\n",
    "* Loop over a set of potential values for the hyper-parameter(s)\n",
    "* For each value of the hyper-parmeter(s) train a classifier on the training set and evaluate it on the **validation** set\n",
    "* Choose the best performing classifier based on its performance on the validation set, and evaluate its performance on the test set.\n",
    "* Report to the user the test-set performance of the classifier chosen based on its performance on the validation set.\n"
