    "We will also see how matrices can be used to compute multiple dot products at one time.\n",

    "A **matrix** is a rectangular array of scalar values (i.e. numbers), which are the **elements** of the matrix.\n",

    "In fact, it's going to be very useful to think of a matrix as a list of vectors.\n",
    "Those vectors, either make up the rows or columns of the matrix, as we will see below.\n",
    "With that in mind, matrices provide us the means to express operations on multiple vectors all at once, which in NumPy, will lead to more efficient code."
