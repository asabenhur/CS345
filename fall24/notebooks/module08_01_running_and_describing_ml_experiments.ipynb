    "\n",
    "You need an appropriate evaluation protocol that ensures no leakage of information from the training set to the test set (here's a [good discussion](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/common_pitfalls.html#data-leakage) on the scikit-learn website), and is appropriate for the way in which the classifier will be used.  You need to report measures of accuracy or error that are appropriate for the problem and data.  For example, if you are dealing with imbalanced data, the standard measure of accuracy is not a good option."
