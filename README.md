For most algorithms we present implementations from scratch and practice using  [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/).
Algorithms are presented using a matrix/vector abstraction that translates to efficient NumPy code.
Neural networks are introduced using [keras](https://keras.io/).


These course materials were developed with help from a grant from the [Colorado Department of Higher Education's OER Council](http://masterplan.highered.colorado.gov/oer-in-colorado/).
